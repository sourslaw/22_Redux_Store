![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

### Description
-

### The User Story for this project is as follows:
- AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform, I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API, SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem


### The codebase meets the following criteria for acceptance:
- WHEN I review the appâ€™s store, THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store, THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
- WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state, THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store, THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions, THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
